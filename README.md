Pro Cycling Manager 2014 Bot
============

A bot written in AutoHotkey to automate the playing of successive stages in the game Pro Cycling Manager 2014.

TODO:
-------------
* Update positions and colors to PCM 2014;
* Fix detection of stage being bugged when it's raining/snowing;
* Support to multiple screen resolutions;
* Support to choose game executable location  (through configuration files or through GUI);
* GUI to start/stop bot, choose game executable location, choose log on/off and respective location;
* Support to start/stop bot remotely (my first choice would be "checking if a file exists" or "read file" -> do action); 
* Detection of a cyclist contract's end and subsequently swapping him for another (yeah right!, this probably isn't worth the effort, but it would be a necessary feature to achieve 100% automation).

P.S. The TODO list is somewhat ordered by importance and ease of implementation.
